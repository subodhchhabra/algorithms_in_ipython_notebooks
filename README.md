#### About this repository

This repository is meant to be a growing collection of interesting and useful algorithms implemented in Python and presented in IPython notebooks. IPython notebooks, because they offer a convenient way for describing the algorithm, benchmarking, maybe even visualization, and eventually sharing and viewing.


#### I am looking forward to your contributions, suggestions, and ideas

If you have any suggestions or want to make additions, I would be very happy if you could send me  
- an [email](mailto:se.raschka@gmail.com),  
- leave me a message on [google+](https://plus.google.com/118404394130788869227/),  
- or even send me a tweet on [twitter](https://twitter.com/rasbt) (given you can fit it within the 140 character limit ;)).  
- Or even better: It would be great if you would simply fork this project and send me a pull request.
